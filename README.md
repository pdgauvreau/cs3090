This repository is a place for my cs 3090 Ethics in Computing classwork. 

Inside, is a password strength checker. By running the file, the user may input a password into the
terminal and receive a report on the strength of the given password. The password is graded on six
things.... 

It is suggested that, for a strong password, you receive green marks on all six categories. However,
passing the majority of them or all but one can be a fairly strong password as well. 


This tool is for demonstrational use only. It does not store any information and will not take any
of your data. Its primary function is to let you test passwords independently from any app or account 
where the password would be used.
